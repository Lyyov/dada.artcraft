      paragraph2: "Saula coffee shops uses best practices of the best Moldavian CAFÉS in this segment to offer a high-quality alternative to expensive ones— good coffee, good service, and reasonable prices. To stand out and be recognizable in the congested coffee shop market, the brand should grab the customers interest and hold their attention with the high quality products, also we had to create an eye catching  design according with the existing old logo for all stationary  and promotional material. The guide should ensure the consistency of each iteration in the local space, for the brand to be perceived as a coherent visual system.",
      paragraph3: "The blend uses four varieties of Arabica coffee beans, all sourced from small, specially selected mountainside plantations. The yellow luminescent colour was used as a key one to symbolize the bright feeling and mood associated with the coffee brand, so we decided to create a coffee shop reachable for everyone."
